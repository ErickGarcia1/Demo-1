SEED Lab-Group 5 Team Agenda

Week 1 (April 15 - April 23):
Brennen:
Work on slowing down the circle the robot does after it arrives at the beacon. Work with Kodi to ensure the camera and new circle speed work together
to get proper angles and distances.
Erick:
Set up the state machine to control the robot as it progresses through the course.
Ben:
Set up communications and work with Erick to make the communications and state machine work together to accomplish design goals.
Kodi:
Make the CV code continuously  detect markers and ensure that correct marker(the closest marker) and data is ready to send to the arduino.
Work with Brennen to ensure the CV code and new motor control system work together.

Week 2 (April 24 - April 30):
Brennen:
Work on integrating all systems together. Be avaible to change motor controls and speed as needed as errors arise throughout testing.
Erick:
Work on integrating all systems together. Work on debugging the state machine and improving it as needed.
Ben:
Work with Erick to integarte all systems on the robot and deal with communication issues as they present themselves within the state machine.
Kodi:
Work on integrating al systems together. Be available to help debug and change the pi code as needed. 

Week 3 (April 31 - May 3):
Brennen:
Work on improving Demo 2 as a fall back in case the final demo does not work. Try to have time to help debug and improve final demo.
Erick:
Work on finishing the final demo and making it consistent.
Ben:
Work on finishing the final demo and making it consistent.
Kodi:
Work on improving Demo 2 as a fall back in case the final demo does not work. Try to have time to help debug and improve final demo.

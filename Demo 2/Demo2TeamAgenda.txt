SEED Lab Group 5 Demo 2 Team Agenda
Brennen:
Pre spring break-Setup basic motor controller and work on making a circle with variable raduis
Week 4/5- Ensure the state machine and the controller code work together
Week 4/12- Speed up the controllers to as fast as we can without losing accuracy
Erick:
Pre spring break- modify robot and marker for new demo and help Brennen start a state machine
Week 4/5- Begin intigrating systems and ensure communications work within state machine
Week 4/12- Work on any debugging errors that come up as well as help with tuning for speed and accuracy
Kodi:
Pre spring break- get the CV code to generate an angle and a distance to be sent to the arduino
Week 4/5- Begin to integrate systems and ensure the CV is as accurate as it needs to be
Week 4/12- Assist with debugging and error correction as the speed of the robot increases
Ben:
Pre spring break- set up communications for easy integration
Week 4/5- Integrate systems via i2c communcation
Week 4/12- Ensure communications are working as intended and help with any other debugging needed by the team
